# Vision Statement

	Students have busy schedules, and finding free time between classes, jobs, and other obligations can be frustrating. When everyone sends their availability into the chat, it can make coordinating a meeting overwhelming, if not impossible. Despite crazy schedules, students are seeking social interaction amidst a socially isolating pandemic. The core intention of this app is to simplify this process of meeting. Students can input their availability into a user-friendly GUI. The app will then return the overlapping times. This is possible through Google Calendar, but it requires more work and hassle than is desirable for those involved. 

	FreeTime, though similar to Google Calendar will not support calendar functionality. However, it will support one's general weekly schedule, wherein the user can add or remove available time slots. While users can create events, they can also view other events that concur or intersect with their free time. This can be achieved by allowing users to view, attend, or be alerted of other local events. Event creators will be able to set event-tags, timeframes, as well as who is allowed/invited to the event. Users can employ event-tags to apply generic labels such as "Group Study", "Team Meeting", or custom tags such as "Bible Study" among others.
