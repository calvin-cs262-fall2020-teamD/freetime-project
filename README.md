# Vision Statement

  Students have busy schedules, and finding freetime between classes, jobs, and other obligations can be frustrating. Especially when everyone is sending their avaialable times in the chat. Despite crazy schedules, students are itching for social interaction amidst a socially isolating pandemic. The core intention of this app is to simplify this process of meeting. Students can input the times they are free into a user-friendly GUI. The app will then return the overlapping times or the next best time, in the event of no overlap. This is possible through Google Calendar, but it requires more work and hassle than is desirable for those involved.

  Another goal is to bring people together for activities. This can be achieved by allowing users to set an event type, some basic examples may include study-sessions, game-nights, workouts, etc. This feature can help to address the issue of diversified interests within a friend-group. Using the overlapping freetime, this app can also alert you of other similar events that you may be interested in. We plan to have generic categories, but we will also make custom event tags available to the user. In the case of private events we may additionally implement an event scope limiter, which allows the user to hide an event from public access.
