# Vision Statement

  Students have busy schedules, and finding a time to hang out in the midst of classes, jobs, homework, and other obligations can be frustrating, especially when everybody just throws out the times they’re free in a chat. But despite crazy schedules, college students are itching for social interaction amidset a social isolating pandemic. The core purpose of this app is to simplify this process. Everybody involved can input the times they’re free into a user-friendly GUI, and the app will spit back the overlapping times (and/or the next best time if there isn’t any overlap). This can be done in something like Google Calendar already, but that involves a lot of inputting data and sharing editing access with the right people, all of which becomes more and more of a hassle the more individuals are involved.

  Beyond that, another goal is to bring people together for activities, and we accomplish this by allowing users to entire their preferred activities. Oftentimes your whole friend group isn’t available or up for a specific activity, but one or two of you really want to still do something. Using the inputed free time, the app can alert you of similar activities other people are doing during that time. We will have general categories but if the user wants to be more specific, they can. You can also choose various privacy options to keep names out of it or have an altogether private event.
