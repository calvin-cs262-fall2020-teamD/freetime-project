# Vision Statement

Students have busy schedules, and finding free time between classes, jobs, and other obligations can be frustrating. When everyone sends their availability into a text chat, it can make coordinating a meeting overwhelming, if not impossible. Despite crazy schedules, students are seeking social interaction amidst a socially isolating pandemic. The core intention of this app is to simplify this process of meeting. Students can input their availability into a user-friendly GUI. The app will then return the overlapping times. Google Calendar is a popular calendar option, but there you enter the time's you're busy, and the UI prompts you for event titles and other information.

FreeTime, though similar to Google Calendar will not support calendar functionality. However, it will support one's general weekly schedule, wherein the user can add or remove available time slots. Users can also create events or view other events that concur or intersect with their free time. Within these groups, in addition to automatically seeing the best time(s) for all the members to meet, the app will also track partial overlap of members' free time. Event creators will be able to set event-tags, timeframes, as well as who is allowed/invited to the event. Users can employ these same event-tags to search for existing events of a certain type. There will be both pre-determined and custom event-tags.
