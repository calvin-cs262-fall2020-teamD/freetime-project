# FreeTime - Meeting Coordination Simplified

The purpose of our app is to help busy groups of students easily find a time to get together despite their differing schedules. This is an issue because, especially for large groups of people such as a dorm floor, everybody simply posting their availability into a group chat can make coordinating a meeting overwhelming or near impossible.

In our app, students can input their general weekly availability into a user-friendly GUI and join/create a group(s) for a dorm floor, friend group, sports team, etc. The app will then calculate the best time for an activity based on the collective availability. Partial overlaps of free times will also be calculated. Furthermore, group creators will be able to add events and give them descriptive tags, timeframes, as well as who is allowed/invited to the event. There will be both pre-determined and custom event-tags.
